b) Your first test will focus on the behavior of ProductFinderService#findProductDetails(id)
This method takes a product id number and gets the product information from the Products API. For
that, ProductFinderService uses an HTTP Client to invoke an HTTP GET method.
Consider that:
• the team has not yet decided on the HTTP Client to use;
• each API call has a cost and the team wants to minimize costs at development time.
• the main aspect to be tested is whether findProductDetails can instantiate well formed objects
from the JSON obtained in the API response.

How would mocking be used in this scenario?

 - o httpClient foi mockado para evitar custos da chamada à API. Também foi retornado um json como exemplo localmente
